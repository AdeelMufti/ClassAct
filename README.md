# ClassAct v1.0.0

## Synopsis

**ClassAct** is a simple, clean and easy to use platform for posting classifieds with image attachments, available in multiple languages. It allows users to register their email or create an account, using an email verification process. Users can post classifieds which are listed publicly on the homepage. The classifieds are searchable and can be narrowed down using categories. **ClassAct** also gives a rich set of functionality to one or multiple administrators, allowing full control over the management of classifieds and users. Furthermore, it can generate regular email digests consisting of the latest classifieds, chosen by the administrator, to all subscribed users. Users have the capability to change their email subscription, change their password, reset their forgotten password, or delete their account.
